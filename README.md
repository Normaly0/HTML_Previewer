# HTML Previewer

A SPA that allows you to preview your markup in realtime.

## About

This applicaton was build as part of the [Front End Development Libraries Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/normaly/front-end-development-libraries).

It uses the react framework in combination with the redux library.

I feel like this would be useful when it comes to teaching someone the fundamentals of HTML structures, as it allows for realtime updates of your work while stripping away everything that could be distracting or overwhelming when starting out with web development (CSS, JS etc.).

Future ideas:
- add the ability to copy your code via a button click
- add ability to add CSS to your markup


## How To Run

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Therefore make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

For more information check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/)!
